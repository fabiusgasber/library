# Library Application

This is a simple library application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s advanced JavaScript curriculum. The project aims to deepen understanding of core JavaScript concepts and browser-based interactions.

## Key Concepts and Skills

Through this project, I enhanced my knowledge and skills in:

- **Objects**: Creating and managing data structures.
- **Constructors**: Using constructor functions and classes to instantiate objects.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating and interacting with the web page's elements.
- **Event Listeners**: Handling user interactions and responding to events.
- **Dialogs and Modals**: Implementing and managing dialog boxes and modals for user input and notifications.
